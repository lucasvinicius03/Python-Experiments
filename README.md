# Python-Experiments
Some random experiments I'm making while learning how to use python's modules.



## Turtle Module:
### turtle-shape-thingy.py
Draws a shape and continuously draws inside it with a configurable offset.

### happy_birthday.py
A simple python file that I made for a friend. It draws balloons on the screen and whishes them happy birthday. The best part is that it can fit in a QR Code so if your phone is has a python IDE it is able to run it 
#### IMPORTANT **(if you're going to run this on a phone make sure to: decrease the font size to 15, set the balloon position addition to 50 instead of 10, set the writer(text, pos) pos variable to (0,60) and (0,-60), set the sleep function to 0.1 instead of 0.03 and the t1.pensize() to 3)**
